Python Basics
What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Key Features:

Easy to Read and Write: Python's syntax is clear and easy to understand.
Interpreted Language: No need for compilation, which makes the development process faster.
Dynamically Typed: Variable types are determined at runtime.
Extensive Standard Library: Provides modules and functions for various tasks.
Community Support: Large and active community with extensive documentation and tutorials.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science: With libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automating repetitive tasks.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Game Development: Using Pygame.
Installing Python
Steps to Install Python:

Windows:

Download the Python installer from python.org.
Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option.
Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing python --version.
macOS:

Python 2.x comes pre-installed on macOS. To install Python 3.x, use Homebrew:
Install Homebrew if not already installed
Install Python 3: brew install python3
Verify the installation by typing python3 --version in Terminal.
Linux:

Use the package manager of your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
Verify the installation by typing python3 --version in the terminal.
Setting Up a Virtual Environment:

Install the venv module if not already installed: pip install virtualenv.
Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv myenv.
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
Python Syntax and Semantics
Hello World Program:

python

print("Hello, World!")
print: A built-in function that outputs the specified message to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string literal.
Data Types and Variables
Basic Data Types:

int: Integer numbers (e.g., 1, -5, 42)
float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.0)
str: String of characters (e.g., "hello")
bool: Boolean values (e.g., True, False)
list: Ordered collection of elements (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
dict: Key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 25})
Script:

python
integers
x = 5
print(x)

 Floats
y = 3.14
print(y)

 Strings
name = "Alice"
print(name)

 Booleans
is_student = True
print(is_student)

 Lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

 Dictionaries
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person)
Control Structures
Conditional Statements:

python

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Loops:

python


for i in range(5):
    print(i)

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
Functions in Python
Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and avoiding repetition.

Example:

python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


result = add(5, 3)
print(result)
Lists and Dictionaries
Lists vs. Dictionaries:

Lists: Ordered collections of elements. Accessed by index.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Accessed by keys.
Example Script:

python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)


person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
person["age"] = 26
print(person)
Exception Handling
Exception Handling:
Exception handling allows you to manage errors in your code gracefully.

Example:

python

try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always execute.")
Modules and Packages
Modules and Packages:

Module: A file containing Python code.
Package: A collection of modules.
Importing a Module:

python

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
File I/O
Reading from and Writing to Files:

Reading:

python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing:

python

lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]

with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
